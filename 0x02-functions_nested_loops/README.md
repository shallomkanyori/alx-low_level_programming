## C - Functions, nested loops

- **Task 0: \_putchar** Write a program that prints \_putchar, followed by a new line.
- **Task 1: I sometimes suffer from insomnia. And when I can't fall asleep, I play what I call the alphabet game.** Write a function that prints the alphabet, in lowercase, followed by a new line.
- **Task 2: 10 x alphabet.** Write a funciton that prints 10 times the alphabet, in lowercase, followed by a new line.
- **Task 3: islower.** Write a function that checks for lowercase character. Return 1 if lowercase, 0 otherwise.
- **Task 4: isalpha.** Write a function that checks for alphabetic character. Return 1 if letter, 0 otherwise.
- **Task 5: Sign.** Write a function that prints the sign of a number. Return 1 if positive, 0 if 0, and -1 if negative.
- **Task 6: There is no such thing as absolute value in this world. You can only estimate what a thing is worth to you.** Write a function that computes the absolute value of an integer.
- **Task 7: There are only 3 colors, 10 digits, and 7 notes; it's what we do with them that's important.** Write a function that prints the last digit of a number and return the value of the last digit.
- **Task 8: I'm a federal agent Jack Bauer, and today is the longest day of my life.** Write a function that prints every minute of the day of Jack Bauer, starting from 00:00 to 23:59.
- **Task 9: Learn your times table.** Write a function that prints the 9 times table, starting with 0.
- **Task 10: a + b.** Write a function that adds two integers and returns the result.
- **Task 11: 98 Battery Street, the OG.** Write a function that  prints all natural numbers from n to 98, followed by a new line.
- **Task 12: In a computer class, the first assignment was to write a program to print the first 100 Fibonacci numbers. Instead I wrote a program that would steal passwords of students. My teacher gave me an A.** Write a program that prints the first 50 Fibonacci numbers, starting with 1 and 2, followed by a new line.

- **Task 12: The World looks like a multiplication-table, or a mathematical equation, which, turn it how you will, balances itself.** Write a function that prints the n times table, starting with 0. If n is greater than 15 or less than 0, the function should not print anything.
- **Task 13: Nature made the natural numbers; All else is the work of women.** Write a program that computes and prints the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1024 (excluded), followed by a new line.
- **Task 14: In computer class, the first assignment was to write a program to print the first 100 Fibonacci numbers. Instead, I wrote a program that would steal passwords of students. My teacher gave me an A.** Write a program that prints the first 50 Fibonacci numbers, starting with 1 and 2, followed by a new line.
- **Task 15: Even Liber Abacci.** By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed 4,000,000, write a program that finds and prints the sum of the even-valued terms.
- **Task 16: In computer class, the first assignment was to write a program to print the first 100 Fibonacci numbers. Instead, I wrote a program that would steal passwords of students. My teacher gave me an A+.** Write a program that finds and prints the first 98 Fibonacci numbers, starting with 1 and 2, followed by a new line, without using the standard library or any other library. You are not allowed to use `long long`, `malloc`, pointers, arrays/tables, or structures. You are not allowed to hard code any Fibonacci number (except 1 and 2).
