## C - Debugging

- **Task 0: Multiple mains.** Write a progarm to test that the function `positive_or_negative()` gives the correct output when given a case of `0`.
- **Task 1: Like, comment, subscribe.** Comment out the part of the code that is causing the output to go into an infinite loop in the copied main file.
- **Task 2: 0 > 972?** Fix the code in 2-largest\_number.c so that it correctly prints out the largest of three numbers, no matter the case.
- **Task 3: Leap year.** Fix the `print_remaining_days()` function so that the output works correctly for all dates and all leap years.
