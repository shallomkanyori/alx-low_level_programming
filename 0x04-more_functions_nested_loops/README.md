## C - More functions, more nested loops

- **Task 0: isupper.** Write a function that checks for uppercase character.
- **Task 1: isdigit.** Write a function that checks for a digit (0 through 9).
- **Task 2: Collaboration is multiplication.** Write a function that multiplies two integers.
- **Task 3: The numbers speak for themselves.** Write a function that prints the numbers, from `0` to `9`, followed by a new line, only using `_putchar` twice.
- **Task 4: I believe in numbers and signs.** Write a function that prints the numbers, from `0` to `9`, except `2` and `4`, followed by a new line, only using `_putchar` twice.
- **Task 5: Numbers constitute the only universal language.** Write a function that prints 10 times the numbers, from `0` to `14`, followed by a new line, only using `_putchar` thrice.
- **Task 6: The shortest distance between two points is a straight line.** Write a function that draws a straight line in the terminal by printing the character `_` n times, followed by a new line, only using `_putchar`. If `n` is `0` or less, print only a new line.
