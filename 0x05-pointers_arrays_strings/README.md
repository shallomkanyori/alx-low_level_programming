## C - pointers, arrays and strings

- **Task 0: 98 Battery st.** Write a function that takes a pointer to an `int` as parameter and updates the value it points to to `98`.
- **Task 1: Don't swap horses in crossing a stream.** Write a function that swaps the values of two integers.
- **Task 2: This report, by its very length, defends itself against the risk of being read.** Write a function that returns the length of a string.
- **Task 3: I do not fear computers. I fear the lack of them.** Write a function that prints a string, followed by a new line, to `stdout`.
- **Task 4: I can only go one way. I've not got a reverse gear.** Write a function that prints a string, in reverse, followed by a new line.
- **Task 5: A good engineer thinks in reverse and asks himself about the stylistic consequences of the components and systems he proposes.** Write a function that reverses a string.
- **Task 6: Half the lies the tell about me aren't true.** Write a function that prints every other character of a string, starting with the first character, followed by a new line.
- **Task 7: Winning is only half of it. Having fun is the other half.** Write a function that prints the second half of a string, followed by a new line. If the number of characters is odd, print the last `n` characters where `n = (length_of_the_string - 1) / 2`.
- **Task 8: Arrays are not pointers.** Write a function that prints the first `n` elements of an array of integers, separated by a comma and a space, followed by a new line.
- **Task 9: strcpy.** Write a function that copies the string pointed to by `src`, including the terminating null byte (`\0`), to the buffer pointed to by `dest` and return the pointer to `dest`.

- **Task 10: Great leaders are willing to sacrifice the numbers to save the people. Poor leaders sacrifice the people to save the numbers.** Write a function that converts a string to an integer without using `long` or hard-coding special values. The number in the string can be preceded by an infinite number of characters. Take into account the `+` and `-` signs before the number.
