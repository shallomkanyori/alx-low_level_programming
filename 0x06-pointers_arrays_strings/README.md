## C - More pointers, arrays and strings

- **Task 0: strcat.** Write a function that concatenates two strings and returns a pointer to the resulting string.
- **Task 1: strncat.** Write a function that concatenates two strings using at most `n` bytes from `src` and returns a pointer to the resulting string.
- **Task 2: strncpy.** Write a function that copies a string that works exactly like `strncpy`.
- **Task 3: strcmp.** Write a function that compares two strings that works exactly like `strcmp`.
- **Task 4: I am a kind of paranoid in reverse. I suspect people of plotting to make me happy.** Write a function that reverses the content of an array of integers
- **Task 5: Always look up.** Write a function that changes all lowercase letters of a string to uppercase.
- **Task 6: Expect the best. Prepare for the worst. Capitalize on what comes.** Write a function that capitalizes all words of a string. Separators of words: space, tabulation, new line, `,`, `;`, `.`, `!`, `?`, `"`, `(`, `)`, `{`, and `}`.
- **Task 7: Mozart composed his music not for the elite, but for everybody.** Write a function that encodes a string into 1337 using only one `if` and only two loops without using `switch` or any ternary operation.
