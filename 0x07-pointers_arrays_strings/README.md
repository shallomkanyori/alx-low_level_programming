## C - Even more pointers, arrays and strings

- **Task 0: memset.** Write a function that fills memory with a constant byte. It should fill the first `n` bytes of the memory area pointed to by `s` with the constant byte `b`, and return a pointer to the memory area `s`.
- **Task 1: memcpy.** Write a function that copies a memroy area. It should copy `n` bytes from memory area `src` to memory area `dest`, and return a pointer to `dest`.
