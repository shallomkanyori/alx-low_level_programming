## C - Even more pointers, arrays and strings

- **Task 0: memset.** Write a function that fills memory with a constant byte. It should fill the first `n` bytes of the memory area pointed to by `s` with the constant byte `b`, and return a pointer to the memory area `s`.
- **Task 1: memcpy.** Write a function that copies a memroy area. It should copy `n` bytes from memory area `src` to memory area `dest`, and return a pointer to `dest`.
- **Task 2: strchr.** Write a function that locates a character in a string and returns a pointer to the first occurrence of that character, or `NULL` if the character is not found.
- **Task 3: strspn.** Write a function that gets the length of a prefix substring. It should return the number of bytes in the initial segment of `s` which consists only of bytes from `accept`.
- **Task 4: strpbrk.** Write a function that searches a string for any of a set of bytes and returns a pointer to the byte that matches one of the accepted bytes or `NULL` if no such byte is found.
- **Task 5: strstr.** Write a function that locates a substring and returns a pointer to the beginning of the located substring, or `NULL` if the substring is not found.
- **Task 6: Chess is mental torture.** Write a function that prints the chessboard.
- **Task 7: The line of life is a ragged diagonal between duty and desire.** Write a function that prints the sum of the two diagonals of a square matrix of integers where matrix is passed as `int*`.

- **Task 8: Double pointer, double fun.** Write a function that sets the value of a pointer to a char using a double pointer.
- **Task 9: My primary goal of hacking was the intellectual curiosity, the seduction of adventure.** Create a file that contains the password to the crackme2 executable.
