## C - Recursion

- **Task 0: She locked away a secret, deep inside herself, something she once knew to be true..but chose to forget.** Write a recursive function that prints a string, followed by a new line.
- **Task 1: Why is it so important to dream? Because, in my dreams we are together.** Write a recursive function that prints a string in reverse.
- **Task 2: Dreams feel real while we're in them. It's only when we wake up that we realize something was actually strange.** Write a recursive function that returns the length of a string.
- **Task 3: You mustn't be afraid to dream a little bigger, darling.** Write a recursive function that returns the factorial of a given number, or `-1` if the number is less than `0`. The factorial of `0` is `1`.
- **Task 4: Once an idea has taken hold of the brain it's almost impossible to eradicate.** Write a recursive function that returns the value of `x` raised to the power of `y` or `-1` if `y` is less than `0`.
- **Task 5: Your subconscious is looking for the dreamer.** Write a recursive function that returns the natural square root of a number or `-1` if the number does not have a natural square root.
- **Task 6: Inception. Is it possible?** Write a recursive function that returns `1` if the input integer is a prime number, otherwise it returns `0`.
