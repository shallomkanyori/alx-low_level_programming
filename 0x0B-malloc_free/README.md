## C - malloc, free

- **Task 0: Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee.** Write a function that creates an array of chars, and initializes it with a specific char. It should return `NULL` if the size given is zero or the array fails to be created. Otherwise it should return a pointer to the array.
- **Task 1: The woman who has no imagination has no wings.** Write a function that returns a pointer to a newly allocated space in memory, which contains a copy of the string given as a parameter. It should return `NULL` if the given string is `NULL` or if there is insufficient memory available.
