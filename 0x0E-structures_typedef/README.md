## C - Structures, typedef

- **Task 0: Poppy.** Define a new type `struct dog` with the following elements: `name`, type = `char *`; `age`, type = `float`; `owner`, type = `char *`.
- **Task 1: A dog is the only thing on earth that loves you more than you love yoursef.** Write a function that initializes a variable of type struct dog.
- **Task 2: A dog will teach you unconditional love. If you can have that in your life, things won't be too bad.** Write a function that prints a `struct dog`. If an element of the struct that is passed in is `NULL`, print `(nil)` instead of this element. If the struct passed in is `NULL`, print nothing.
- **Task 3: Outside of a dog, a book is man's best friend. Inside of a dog it's too dark to read.** Define a new type `dog_t` as a new name for the type `struct dog`.
- **Task 4: A door is what a dog is perpetually on the wrong side of.** Write a function that creates a new dog. Return `NULL` if the function fails.
