## C - Function pointers

- **Task 0: What's my name.** Write a function that calls a function passed in as a parameter that prints a name.
- **Task 1: If you spend too much time thinking about a thing, you'll never get it done.** Write a function that executes a function given as a parameter on each element of an array.
- ** Task 2: To hell with circumstances; I create opportunities.** Write a function that searches for an integer using a function given as a parameter to compare values.
- **Task 3: A goal is not always meant to be reached, it often serves simply as something to aim at.** Write a program that performs simple arithmetic operations. Usage: `calc num1 operator num2`. You can assume `num1` and `num2` are integers and the result of all operations can be stored in an `int`. The program should print the result of the operation, followed by a new line. If the number of arguments is wrong, if the operator is not in [+, -, \*, /, %], or if the user tries to divide by `0`, print `Error\n` and exit with a status of `98`, `99`, or `100` respectively.
