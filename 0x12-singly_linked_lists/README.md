## C - Singly linked lists

- **Task 0: Print list.** Write a funciton that prints all the elements of a `list_t` list and returns the number of nodes. If `str` is `NULL`, print `[0] (nil)`.

- **Task 1: List length.** Write a function that returns the number of elements in a linked `list_t` list.

- **Task 2: Add node.** Write a function that adds a new node at the beginning of a `list_t` list and returns the address of the new element, or `NULL` if it failed.

- **Task 3: Add node at the end.** Write a function that adds a new node at the end of a `list_t` list and returns the address of the new element, or `NULL` if it failed.

- **Task 4: Free list.** Write a function that frees a `list_t` list.


- **Task 5: The Hare and the Tortoise.**Write a function that prints `You're beat! and yet, you must allow,\nI bore my house upon my back!\n` before the `main` function is executed.

- **Task 6: Real programmers can write assembly code in any language.** Write a 64-bit program in assembly that prints `Hello, Holberton` followed by a new line. You are only allowed to use the `printf` function. You are not allowed to use interrupts. Your program will be compiled using `nasm` and `gcc`.
