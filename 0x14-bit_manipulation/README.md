## C - Bit manipulation

- **Task 0: 0.** Write a function that converts a binary number given as a string of `0` and `1` chars to an `unsigned int` and returns the converted number or 0 if there is one or more chars in the string that is not `0` or `1` or if the string is `NULL`.

- **Task 1: 1.** Write a function that prints the binary representation of a number. You are not allowed to use arrays, `malloc` or the `%` or `/` operators.
