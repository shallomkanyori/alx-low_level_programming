## C - File I/O

- **Task 0: Tread lightly, she is near.** Write a function that reads a text file and prints it a given number of letters to the `POSIX` standard output. It should return the actual number of letters it could read and print. If the given file can not be opened or read, return `0`. If the given filename is `NULL`, return `0`. If `write` fails or does not write the expected amount of bytes, return `0`.
